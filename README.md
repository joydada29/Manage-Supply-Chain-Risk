Overview 

This report evaluates the risk and compliance posture of the PeoplePro Suite, a third-party HR platform considered by Monistax. It examines operational threats such as SQL injection, phishing without MFA, session hijacking, insider misuse, and cloud misconfigurations, as well as compliance gaps with Monistax’s third-party supplier security policy. The assessment highlights risks that could significantly impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive HR data.

Objectives: Identify and assess high-impact and high-likelihood risks affecting the PeoplePro Suite, to evaluate vendor compliance with Monistax’s security and data protection requirements, to map findings against industry standards such as OWASP, NIST SP 800-53, and ISO/IEC 27001, and to provide prioritized recommendations that will reduce residual risk before adoption.

Key Findings: Several risks, such as SQL injection leading to administrator access, phishing attacks without MFA, session hijacking, and insufficient logging, are not acceptable in their current state. Other significant risks include cloud misconfigurations, excessive insider privileges, and brute-force login attempts. The compliance review revealed missing vendor security policies, the absence of a vulnerability prevention clause, unclear data retention and deletion practices, and weak breach notification timelines. Risk prioritization determined that SQL injection, phishing, session hijacking, and logging issues are the most urgent threats to address.

Tools & Techniques: Conducted using risk matrix scoring, likelihood and impact analysis, and threat and attack-path modeling. A compliance gap review was performed against Monistax’s policies and international standards. The analysis referenced industry frameworks including OWASP Top 10, NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001, ENISA cloud guidance, GDPR, and CCPA to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Outcomes: Provides a clear understanding of Monistax’s risk exposure if the PeoplePro Suite is adopted without mitigations. It delivers an actionable remediation plan that includes deploying a web application firewall, enforcing multi-factor authentication, strengthening session management, enhancing monitoring and logging, and auditing cloud configurations. It also recommends contractual updates for breach notifications, data retention and deletion, and vendor certification. These steps establish a pathway to reduce residual risk to an acceptable level and enable Monistax to safely integrate the PeoplePro Suite.
